# Nan_Postscript
This is a very basic set of libraries (C++) in order to draw some pretty geometric stuff with Postscript. The main libraries used here are 'Postscript', 'Vector' and 'Matrix'. This libraries are are not always necessary, they're used just when you want to draw in 3D models. You can find craziest things on http://michelle.esfm.ipn.mx/eduardo.viruena/
